# PyPlayground
*a collection of python projects made in my freetime*

## What is PyPlayground?

PyPlayground is a collection of what I make for fun in python. Most of the projects are coded on my phone, using [Pyroid3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3).
I highly recommend using that app to run those scripts, as they are designed with touch controls in mind.

## What can I do with these scripts?

You are fully allowed to take any and all code located in here, as it is licensed in the MIT license. 
It is not obligatory, but I ask that you link to this repo when you take code from here. 
Feel free to modify any of this code to make it run on your computer, I'd be happy to allow pull requests that make this code run on different platforms.

## I don't have android, how can I run these scripts?

You can. In my experience, it won't run as well as in Pyroid, if the script imports pygame, the screen will be irresponsive, and some controls might not work.
Once again, feel free to modify any code to your liking, I'm sure that there are better ways to make all code found here.
Most of the freezing and unresponsiveness, I have found, is caused by the scripts not having a quit function.
